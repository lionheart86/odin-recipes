            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">In a large skillet over medium heat, warm oil and saute ground beef with the onion,<br>
                sage and rosemary; cook until meat is evenly browned and crumbly. 
                                Drain fat.<br>
                Add salt and 1/2 cup white wine; cook until wine is evaporated. Set mixture aside.</li>

            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">To make the Bechamel sauce: Melt 4 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat.<br>
                Add flour and stir until well incorporated. Stir in milk and bring to a slow boil until mixture thickens.<br>
                Remove sauce from the heat. In a steady stream, pour the bechamel in to the beaten egg yolks,<br>
                whisking constantly. Stir the sauce into the meat mixture. Stir in the cubed mozzarella.</li>

            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter and saute onion until soft<br>
                and translucent.
                                    Add 1/2 cup white wine and let it cook down to evaporate; add stewed tomatoes<br>
                and salt. Mix well; simmer for 15 minutes.
            </li>

            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta, a few at a time,<br> 
                and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; using a slotted spoon, remove immediately<br> 
                to a pot filled with cold water. Lift pasta out with slotted spoon and arrange on a flat surface.</li>

            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>

            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Spoon a line of filling into each shell, starting from one end and using your finger to push<br> 
                the filling inside of each shell. Place cannelloni in prepared baking dish and cover with tomato<br> 
                sauce mixture.</li>
